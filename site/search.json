The guide has been designed for use by curators and other authors who work in or outside the Museum, by their assistants, and by editors, production managers, and proofreaders, and by other Museum departments that create published content, whether in print or online.\n This guide is not intended to establish an inflexible house style, as every manuscript has its own particular characteristics and requirements; it does, however, address areas of confusion about which the Editorial Department frequently receives inquiries with a view toward establishing an ideal set of guidelines and practices for use in most situations.\n The guide is divided into three parts. The first outlines the procedures involved in producing books and catalogues, as well as labels; the second provides a style guide for use in writing and editing Museum publications; and the third specifically addresses bibliographies and notes, as these are among the most complicated components of most of our publications.\n Although the Editorial Department regards certain reference books as authoritative (these volumes are listed in the section titled Sources), many of the Museum’s special needs and functions are not addressed in these publications. In addition, specialized usages have been adopted by Museum editors over the years. Therefore, in the interest of Museum-wide consistency, recommended usages for many different types of material are given herein. The aim is not only to help authors but also to aid readers and visitors who might otherwise be confused or distracted by variations in spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and so on.\n The primary role of the Editorial Department is to make sure that texts are clear, accurate, and consistent, and that books are produced at the highest level of quality that schedule and budget will allow. Authors are expected to deliver accurate and complete manuscripts on time, and the editor assigned to the project is responsible for correcting errors of grammar and spelling, suggesting rewording or reorganization to achieve greater clarity, and querying any questionable facts or inconsistencies. It is also the editor’s responsibility to work with the designer and the Editorial production staff to ensure that the text and illustrations are integrated into an accurate, appropriate, and attractive publication and that schedules and budgets are respected.\n It is worth noting here that The Chicago Manual of Style, the standard reference accepted by virtually all American publishers, is now in its sixteenth edition (and is available in an online edition as well), and it bears very little resemblance to the first edition. Like Chicago, this style guide will continue to undergo changes over its lifetime, and suggestions will happily be considered.\n","id":1,"length":480,"title":"Foreword","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/foreword/"},{"content":"","id":2,"length":"","title":"Part I. Editorial Procedures","type":"","url":""},{"content":"The following information is intended to assist authors in the preparation of their manuscripts and related material for submission to the Editorial Department. Most of the general instructions about manuscript preparation apply to books, exhibition and collection catalogues, checklists, wall labels, and miscellaneous brochures, pamphlets, or other forms of printed matter. Because books (including catalogues) and wall labels require special procedures, however, separate sections devoted to them follow the general discussion of manuscript preparation.\n See Typing The Manuscript\n Preparing a Text File By “manuscript” we mean the completed work in the form of a Microsoft Word file or files sent to an editor by email.\nFile names should indicate the order of the texts (chap1, chap2, and so on). Chapters or sections of books and lengthy catalogue entries may be submitted each in its own file. For books, front matter (title page, table of contents, foreword, list of lenders to the exhibition, and preface and acknowledgments), back matter (appendixes, glossary, bibliography, tombstone information, and photo credits), and illustration captions should be grouped in files separate from the texts.\nFiles for essays should include the text and the accompanying notes, styled as endnotes and created using the “Footnotes” function in Word (under the “References” tab). Files for catalogue entries should contain all material related to the text: notes, provenance, exhibition history, and references. Please make a separate file for each individual text (essay or entry) to avoid confusion over consecutively numbered endnotes. When naming files, it is best to avoid the use of special characters such as brackets, commas, ampersands, exclamation points, quotation marks, and parentheses (underscores are acceptable).\n Author’s Responsibilities Authors (both in-house curators and non-staff authors) are expected to submit a complete manuscript, including notes, and a list of images with all pertinent information (see Image Acquisitions), by the deadline agreed upon with Editorial. Normally, this deadline is one year before publication or exhibition date. Timely delivery allows for sufficient discussion between author and editor during the editing process; the later the delivery, the less time the author has to review edits and make revisions. It also helps us to avoid errors and budget overruns.\nThe manuscript, including a full art list (with captions), should be delivered to the editor assigned to the project. If multiple views exist of a given object, the author should specify which view is preferred. To facilitate the editorial, design, and production functions, the Editorial Department asks that a author submit several elements at the outset of the project, even though they are not yet in final form:\n Table of contents (preliminary version) List of catalogue entries List of illustrations (tentative)  In addition, the author will be responsible for delivering the following components before a manuscript can be considered fully submitted:\n Title page Table of contents (final version) Draft of the Director’s Foreword List of lenders to the exhibition Preface and acknowledgments Introduction Text with notes Catalogue entries with apparatus and notes (if applicable) Appendices (if applicable) Glossary (if applicable) Chronology (if applicable) Bibliography Captions for illustrations List of illustrations (final)   Sponsor Credits See Captions, Credit Lines, Editorial Procedures (Labels), Names\nBooks that are subsidized or that accompany funded exhibitions carry credit lines on the copyright page. The correct wording for these credits is supplied by Development, which must review the copyright page and the sponsor’s foreword, if there is one, before the book goes to press. Development is also responsible for reviewing the acknowledgments in the Director’s Foreword as well as those written by the curator. The curatorial department is responsible for identifying all credit lines that have not been approved by Archives as per the object record in TMS. The Editorial Department asks Archives to verify all unapproved credit lines. Archives submits corrections to Editorial.\n Acknowledgments Authors may acknowledge the assistance of institutions and individuals at the end of a preface, in a separate Acknowledgments section if there are enough names to warrant one, or in a headnote preceding numbered endnotes of an essay or catalogue entry. In any case, acknowledgments should be brief. In exhibition catalogues and certain other scholarly publications, acknowledgments may be incorporated into the Director’s Foreword. In this case, the author should supply the Office of the Director and Development, as well as Editorial, with a complete list of the names, titles, and affiliations of people to be thanked.\n Sources See Captions, Credit Lines, Names, Spelling\nConsult the following standard reference works for spelling and style: Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, unabridged, for spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and word division. Do not italicize any foreign word that appears in Webster’s Third. See Spelling below for a list of preferred spellings; those that differ from Webster’s are marked with an asterisk. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed., 2003) is a desk-size work that is based on and in some instances updates Webster’s Third. It is an invaluable reference tool for all authors and editors. Where there is disagreement, follow the spelling given in Webster’s Eleventh.\nRandom House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary may be used for art terminology and for other words not found in Webster’s Third or Webster’s Eleventh.\nPersonal names: Use the individual’s preference when known. Otherwise, use Merriam-Webster’s Biographical Dictionary (3rd ed., 1995).\nPlace-names: Use Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary (3rd ed., 1997). Names of very small, remote, or little-known places that do not appear in Webster’s can often be found in the most recent edition of The Times Atlas of the World.\nGeneral style: This style manual is based on The Chicago Manual of Style (16th ed., rev., Chicago, 2010). The online version of The Chicago Manual of Style is available to MMA staff and onsite visitors to the MMA through Watsonline.\nGeneral reference: The Columbia Encyclopedia (6th ed., rev. 2000) can resolve many questions about historical and cultural events and dates. Spelling of artists’ names: Approved Artists Running List (a.k.a. MMA Approved Constituents Records, available to MMA staff on the Intranet in TMS Documents); Oxford Art Online (available to MMA staff through Watsonline); Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) on the Getty Research Insitute’s website; the Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon; and the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie’s online database of artists’ names for Dutch and Flemish artists.\nNames of museums: Consult IDA (International Directory of Arts), The Official Museum Directory, or a museum’s official website for the correct way to refer to museums (see Names).\nBible: The Authorized (King James) Version is preferred for the majesty of its style, but some departments may choose to use the Douay Version or the Revised Standard Version.\n Typing the Manuscript Double-space all material, including notes, extracts, bibliographies, and captions. Notes should be placed after the text (as endnotes rather than footnotes), be in the same size as the main text, and be double-spaced.\nAuthors should not concern themselves with formatting the text, except to indicate italicization, cross-references, and extracts (for all three, see below). Use upper- and lowercase letters, not all caps or small caps, for headings, subheads, chapter titles, and other elements of your manuscript that will eventually appear as display type.\nLeave ample margins, about 1 1/2 inches on the left and at least 1 inch on the right. Keep the same margins on every page and the same number of lines per page. The right-hand margin should be ragged, not justified.\nDo not manually break words at the ends of lines. Turn off the automatic hyphenation feature in Word (Page Layout tab \u0026gt; Hyphenation \u0026gt; select None). The only hyphens in your manuscript should be in hyphenated compound words.\nTurn off fractions (1/2) and ordinals (1st). The path is: File tab \u0026gt; Word options \u0026gt; Proofing \u0026gt; AutoCorrect Options button \u0026gt; AutoFormat tab; from the list, uncheck “Fractions with fraction character” and “Ordinals with superscript.”\nType straight text in paragraph style, with a one-tab indent on the first line. Use the return key (Enter) at the end of a paragraph. Do not create hanging indents with your software (the first line flush left and the remaining lines indented).\nAfter a period, use just one space before the start of the next sentence.\nFor indents, do not use spaces; instead, use the tab key or the automatic indent function on the ruler. Do not leave extra lines between paragraphs unless you wish to indicate a major break that should be preserved in the printed book.\nNever use letters to indicate numbers as, for example, the lowercase l for the number one or the letter O for zero.\nUse serial commas (e.g., The artist sketched the landscape in ink, oil, and acrylic on paper).\nEm dashes and en dashes ( — and – ) should be entered in Word by using the appropriate keystrokes: On a PC: Ctrl + Alt + - for an em dash; Ctrl + - for an en dash. [NB: use the minus key on the numeric pad to the right; it will not work with the one at the top of the keyboard.] On a Mac: Shift + Option + - for an em dash; Option + - for an en dash. However, it is also acceptable to use one hyphen for an en dash and two for an em dash. All dashes should be closed up (no space in-between) to the characters preceding and following them. (See Punctuation: Hyphens, En Dashes, and Em Dashes for specific rules regarding the use of en and em dashes.)\nItalicized material should be indicated by using the Italic command.\nFor cross-references to text and illustrations, type a blind reference, with the zeros in bold, and indicate the relevant manuscript page or name or number assigned to the artwork (e.g., see page 00 [32]); (fig. 00 [Portrait of a Man]).\nVerse quotations, unless unusual emphasis is required, should be run into the text and enclosed in quotation marks with a slash ( / ) separating each line of the poem (e.g., The children said in unison, “Twinkle, twinkle, little star / How I wonder what you are,” and ran into the hallway).\n When not run in, poetry extracts should be set off by one blank line (one extra hard return) above and below. It is not necessary to indent the poem. That will be handled by the typesetter. Quotation marks are not needed unless they occur within the poem itself. Do not indicate runover lines unless the poem needs to be reproduced line by line, but do indicate the end of a line by a hard return.\nProse quotations of fewer than eight lines should be run into the text and enclosed in quotation marks. Note that quotations within such quotations take single quotation marks. Quotations of eight lines or more are set off from the text by a blank line (one extra hard return) above and below. These set-off quotations are called “extracts.” Extracts may be indented in Word by using the “Increase Indent” button (lines with right-pointing arrow) under the Home tab \u0026gt; Paragraph. No quotation marks are used at the beginning or end of set-off extracts, so internal quotation marks remain as they are in the original.\nIn quotations from sources using British spelling and punctuation, punctuation should be Americanized (double quotation marks, periods and commas within quotation marks), but British spelling should be retained. For an ellipsis within a sentence, use three dots, leaving equal space before the first and after the last dot as well as between each of the three. Four dots indicate the omission of (1) the last part of a quoted sentence, (2) the first part of the next sentence, or (3) a whole sentence or more. When using four dots, the first is a period closed up to the preceding word, and the next three are spaced as described above. Retain an exclamation point or question mark from the original material instead of the first period in a four-period ellipsis, but replace commas, semicolons, or colons from the original with a period. Quotations should neither begin nor end with an ellipsis.\nWhen the text contains special ligatures or archaic or non-Western languages, these should be discussed in advance with Editorial, or a PDF or image provided to show what the type should look like.\nIf the manuscript contains tables, the author should supply accurate printouts so that the typesetter can easily follow their format. Tables can be submitted either in Microsoft Excel or as a Microsoft Word table. If the table is set up manually in Microsoft Word, however, use only a one-tab space between columns; although the columns will not look aligned on-screen, the single-tab formatting will help the typesetter.\n","id":3,"length":2086,"title":"Manuscript Preparation","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/editorial-procedures/1/"},{"content":"Schedules, Budgets, and Approvals Editorial generally requires a minimum of two years to plan, edit, and produce a major exhibition catalogue.\nApproximately two years before the exhibition’s opening, members of Editorial meet with the curator to discuss catalogue content, format, bibliographic style, contributing authors, word counts, number of illustrations, and authors’ fees; and to determine key delivery dates for text and photographs. Curators should provide for this meeting a proposed table of contents, book description, and exhibition dates and venues, and a list of contributing authors with their proposed assignments. They should also confirm whether the exhibition has been approved by the Director’s Office, and whether any funding has been secured. At this meeting, Editorial will fill out the New Publication Planning Agreement, which is the basis for preparing a budget. Curators are invited to read the blank form beforehand in preparation for the discussion. The Publication Planning Agreement can be found on the Intranet in the Editorial Department’s Sharepoint site (https://metropolitan.sharepoint.com/sites/departments/editorial).\nOnce sufficient information has been gathered, Editorial prepares a preliminary catalogue budget for the Director’s review and approval. Please note that a catalogue should not be assumed, or announced on the Exhibitions calendar, until it has been discussed with Editorial and approved by the Director.\nAfter the catalogue budget is approved by the Director, the curator should provide Editorial with the list of approved contributing authors, including contact information and writing assignments. Editorial prepares and sends contracts to all outside contributing authors. Editorial is responsible for setting deadlines for delivery of text and negotiating fees with outside contributors; curatorial departments are specifically asked not to confirm with outside contributors that they will be writing for the publication before the proposal and budget has been officially approved. In no circumstances should MMA curators negotiate fees with outside contributors.\nIf a contributing author is also a guest curator of the exhibition and has signed an independent contractor agreement with the MMA, this agreement typically includes arrangements for the guest curator’s catalogue contributions.\n Contracts When an outside (non-MMA staff) author is engaged to write essays, entries, or other texts, the Editorial Department prepares a contract to cover the assignment of copyright to the Museum (under the terms of “work made for hire”), as well as information regarding deadlines, payment of the fees, warranties about the originality of the material, and various other issues for which the author might be responsible. Contracts are not usually drawn up with authors on the Museum’s staff, nor are fees paid (except for the Metropolitan Museum Journal).\nContracts are issued once the project budget has been approved by the Director (see Schedules, Budgets, and Approvals). Please note that Editorial cannot issue outside author contracts or begin incurring costs on a given project until that project has been officially approved. Authors are encouraged to sign and return their contracts to Editorial as quickly as possible . In most cases, payment is due to the author either upon signature of contract or delivery of acceptable manuscript, along with presentation of an invoice . Authors cannot be paid until Editorial has received both a signed, fully executed contract and an invoice.\n Editing An editor is assigned to the catalogue when the manuscript is received by Editorial (or at an earlier point if feasible). Assignments are made on the basis of availability, though curatorial preference is taken into account whenever possible. If the author and/or curator have questions during the preparation of the manuscript, they may consult with the managing editor or the editor, if one has been assigned.\nPlease note: Editorial expects the text from all contributors to be vetted by the coordinating curator before it is delivered to Editorial for editing; this step needs to be taken into consideration when text deadlines are set.\nDuring the editing process, the editor queries the author for the purpose of clarifying meaning, achieving consistency and concision, and conforming to the MMA’s internal style. After the manuscript is edited, it is reviewed by the author and, in the case of multiple authors, by the organizing curator. The author is expected to respond to queries, accept or reject the editor’s changes, and return the edited manuscript by the specified date. When all reviews are completed, the manuscript is sent out for typesetting.\nEditors keep a style sheet of instances of punctuation and spelling that vary from this style guide.\n Copyright With few exceptions, the Museum holds the copyright for every work it publishes. The Museum also holds copyright to texts written by staff members if the works are prepared within the scope of Museum duties, and in most cases to work commissioned from outside authors. When the Museum holds the copyright for a published text, the author who wishes to reprint his or her work at a later time should write to the Editorial Department for permission, which will not be unreasonably withheld.\nFor questions pertaining to copyright of illustrations and permissible use of images, please consult with Editorial.\nThe Editorial Department will prepare copy for the copyright page and will apply to the Library of Congress for Cataloging-in-Publication (CIP) data. The assistant managing editor is responsible for applying for CIP data. CIP is a service of the Library of Congress, through which a work is catalogued for librarians. CIP data is usually printed on the copyright page.\n Image Acquisitions As a general rule, the Editorial Department, through its Image Acquisitions and Permissions group, collects images (for works of art on loan and comparative photographs) from institutions other than the MMA, and clears permissions for their use for most non-commercial purposes throughout the Museum (catalogue, exhibition, press and publicity, education, social media, and some Web use). This centralized approach allows greater efficiency among departments and ensures that costs are minimized, and schedules well planned with regard to clearing image rights . The precise work flow may vary slightly from project to project, depending on the specific circumstances.\nA preliminary number of images for a publication (catalogue objects plus comparatives) should be set at an initial meeting between the curator and the Editorial department when the publication is first planned; this information is necessary to help craft a project budget. Once the project budget has been approved, the curator arranges to meet with the image acquisitions manager to discuss the acquisition of non-Met images.\nA specific image list is due from the curator with the manuscript on a specifically scheduled date, usually one year in advance of the publication date. Once the list has been mutually agreed upon by the curator and Editorial, Editorial gathers the images and puts them into the digital asset management system.\nImage lists should include artist/maker (including birth–death dates, as listed on the MMA Approved Constituents List), title or description, date, medium, dimensions, repository, and inventory number. Digital scans or other image representations are very helpful. The image list should include vetted lists from outside authors; curators should request image lists from outside authors earlier than deadline, to leave time for review and possible revision before the submission date. Once the image list has been submitted to Editorial, any further changes to it, including requests for additional images, must be agreed upon between the author and Editorial; any such agreed-upon changes should be communicated immediately to both the editor and the image acquisitions manager associated with the project to avoid unnecessary acquisitions and payments.\nGenerally speaking, images cannot be changed or replaced once they have been acquired by Editorial, as such changes entail significant additional expenditure of time and money. Any requests to change, add, or replace images after this point will be decided by Editorial on a case-by-case basis.\nOrders for new photography of Met objects should be submitted directly from the curatorial department to the Photograph Studio with a due date that fits the publication schedule. If scans from books are required, the Editorial department will place the relevant IOWA order with the Photograph Studio.\nIf new photography of non-Met objects is needed, Editorial will commission new photography from the Photograph Studio, a freelance photographer, or the lending institution.\nImages to be used for purposes other than those requested by Editorial, including images for research purposes, are ordered directly by the curator at the expense of the curatorial department.\n","id":4,"length":1372,"title":"The Publishing Process","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/editorial-procedures/2/"},{"content":"Label copy generally includes:\n Text panels introducing the exhibition and its primary sections  Labels for walls and cases consisting of a “tombstone,” or ID, and, frequently,  a brief description, or “chat”  Group labels for cases\nThe tombstone may supply artist, nationality, birth and death dates, birth and death locations, title of work, date of work, medium, credit line, and accession number. Only works in the Museum collection need an accession number. Tombstones do not include dimensions. Please see below for tombstone format templates.\nWhenever possible, the following guidelines for labels will also apply to tombstones in publications.\n Exhibition Labels Special exhibition labels should be prepared with the same care given to any Museum publication. When labels are edited, deviations from Museum style will be corrected. The Design Department provides type specifications to the Editorial Department, which handles typesetting. All Word docs provided by curatorial must be organized to conform to the needs of the Design Department—i.e., all case labels in one file, all text panels in a second, all wall labels in a third, and so on—and not exceed the maximum word count for each type of label. For this reason, curators should meet with the graphic designer assigned to the project before beginning to write. Label copy thus organized should be emailed to the Editorial Department. The editor will provide each curator with edited text with all corrections, suggestions, and queries in Word documents with tracked changes. Editorial will email the curator a PDF of the first proofs; the curator should note corrections in red on a printout or in the PDF file(s) using Adobe sticky notes. Editor and curator will decide which method to use, but PDF is usually preferred, as it is faster. First proofs should be returned to the editor in a timely fashion. If necessary, second proofs will be generated; curators generally do not review second proofs.\n The importance of timely delivery of material to Editorial cannot be overemphasized. Because special exhibitions follow tight schedules, all copy for text panels and labels should be submitted to the Editorial Department at least twelve weeks before the opening. After initial edits, the Director’s Office will review introductory panels and text panels for certain special exhibitions and further edits will be made if necessary. If material must be delivered in sections, priority should be given to copy that is to be silk-screened (usually, intro panels and wall panels).\n Permanent Installation and Replacement Labels Labels for permanent installation rotations that have been approved and scheduled with the Exhibitions Department, as well as labels to update or correct existing text, are due to Editorial ten weeks prior to the installation. Rotation and replacement labels will be edited and produced as quickly as possible; please note, however, that time-sensitive projects, such as major exhibition labels, might have to take precedence.\n Length of Labels Exhibition texts should be brief and concise. In general, text panels cannot exceed 250 words (or 200 if they include an image with a caption); wall labels, 125 words; and case labels, 75 words. These word counts do not include tombstones. Please note that these numbers are estimates only: final word counts may need to be adjusted in editing to ensure that the typeset text fits on the label, depending on the particular label design, length of object information, etc. Again, please meet with the graphic designer assigned to your exhibition before you begin writing, as there may be exceptions to these general guidelines depending on specific gallery configurations.\n Label Templates The following label styles have been devised with the needs of the various curatorial departments in mind; only one style should be adopted per gallery or exhibition. If the specific exhibition requires altering one of these templates, including reordering the information, please confer with the editor:\n1 Maker (nationality, birth/death dates if known) [in certain departments—DPP,  Photographs—nationality and birth/death dates are on next line]  Title, date  Medium  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 1  Goya (Francisco de Goya y Lucientes) (Spanish, Fuendetodos 1746–1828  Bordeaux)  Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuñiga, 1787–88  Oil on canvas  The Jules Bache Collection, 1949 (49.7.41)\n2  Title  Medium [if appropriate]  Maker (nationality, birth/death dates if known)  Date [+ place]  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 2  Adam  Marble  Tullio Lombardo (ca. 1455–1532) Italian (Venice), ca. 1490–95  Fletcher Fund, 1936 (36.163)\n3  Title  Medium  Cultural designation, object date  Find spot (if known/appropriate)  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 3  Virgin and Child Reliquary  Walnut with paint, tin relief on a white lead ground, linen  French, Auvergne, carved about 1175–1200  Gift of J.

O. Havemeyer Collection, Bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, 1929  (29.100.223)\nNoted for its imaginative designs and innovative techniques, Jizhou ware was produced at kilns in Jiangxi Province in southern China. Here, paper-cut plum blossoms were placed on an initial layer of black glaze and covered with brown glaze. The paper cuts were destroyed during the firing, leaving the design of plum blossoms on the inside of the bowl. \n(Note: In the tombstone, “The Metropolitan Museum of Art” is not used in the credit line for rotation labels of permanent collection objects.)\n General Label Style See Dates\nDo not use periods at the ends of lines in the tombstone.\nUse serial commas (e.g., “Ink, oil, and acrylic” rather than “Ink, oil and acrylic”).\nIn a chat, spell out numbers from one hundred down (“eleven prints in the series”) as well as centuries (“fifteenth,” not “15th”) but use numerals in the tombstone. An exception in tombstones is a fraction of a century: “First third 14th century.”\nEnclose question marks in parentheses and do not leave a space following the preceding word: “Italian(?), ca. 1400.”\n“Ex coll.” may be included at the discretion of the department. If it is a matter of particular sensitivity, it should be flagged in TMS.\nDates of an artist’s activity do not appear in the tombstone unless artist’s birth/ death dates are unknown. When needed, use “active” rather than “recorded” or “flourished.”\nFor anonymous works, use country or culture followed by a comma and the date (French, 15th century) and do not include the word “anonymous.”\nHowever, do leave “anonymous” in TMS as a sorting mechanism; use “anonymous” instead of “artist unknown” or other variant wordings.\n","id":5,"length":1129,"title":"Labels","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/editorial-procedures/3/"},{"content":"","id":6,"length":"","title":"Part II.

Catalogue entries usually begin with a heading (“tombstone”) that gives basic information about each object or group of objects, as follows:\n Catalogue number (if used)  Artist, nationality, dates (omitted if book is a monograph)  Title of work  Where created, date (date may also follow title)  Material/medium  Dimensions (may be on the same line as the material)  Signature/inscription information  Credit line, followed by accession number in parentheses\nEntries usually include text, which may vary in length depending on the nature of the catalogue. Comparative illustrations—illustrations (with captions) of alternate views, details, or related objects—may accompany the entry; these are usually given a set of numbers different from those of the catalogue objects and are referred to as “figures” or “comparatives” (“fig.” in captions or within parentheses).\nEntries might also include separate elements, called “apparatus” (often set in smaller type than the heading and text), such as notes to the text of the entry, Provenance, References, Exhibitions, Condition, and Related Works. As an alternative, it has become increasingly common to place the apparatus at the back of the book in a comprehensive checklist, rather than include it with the entry.\nLength of entries, inclusion and number of figures, and placement and extent of apparatus should be decided between the author and Editorial in the planning stages for the project.\n","id":12,"length":266,"title":"Catalogue Entries","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/general-style-matters/6/"},{"content":"See Editorial Procedures (Author’s Responsibilities: Sponsor Credits), Editorial Procedures (Labels), Captions, Names\nWhen writing a credit line for a work in the Museum’s collection, use only the line approved by Archives.

Before shortening or eliminating a credit line, you must consult the Counsel’s Office.\nWhen writing a credit line for a work not in the Museum’s collection, use the exact wording of the credit line dictated by the collector or institution, except that Chicago abbreviations for states should be used, not U.S. Postal Service twoletter abbreviations.

Collection and some exhibition catalogues might also contain special reference/exhibition histories. The author and Editorial Department should choose the bibliographic style together at the beginning of the project.\nAny direct quotation from a primary or secondary source should be documented in a note, citing full bibliographic information and page numbers. Ideas or interpretations attributed to or facts discovered by another writer must also be documented. To avoid overwhelming the text with superscripts, references to ideas or interpretations can sometimes be grouped into a single note (for instance, at the end of the relevant paragraph).\nAuthors are responsible for paying close attention to accuracy and completeness in noting authors’ names, titles, dates and places of publication, volume numbers, page and figure numbers, etc., and to consistency between notes and bibliography.

If there is more information than the examples below call for, by all means include it in the citation and the editor will make any necessary style changes. Please note that the bibliographic editor’s job is to edit the notes and references for style and consistency, not to research missing information, which is the responsibility of the author.\nThe bibliography should be assembled in a single alphabetized file according to authors’ last names. Multiple works by the same author should be arranged chronologically from earliest to most recent.

Only works in the Museum collection need an accession number. Tombstones do not include dimensions. Please see below for tombstone format templates.\nWhenever possible, the following guidelines for labels will also apply to tombstones in publications.\n Exhibition Labels Special exhibition labels should be prepared with the same care given to any Museum publication. When labels are edited, deviations from Museum style will be corrected. The Design Department provides type specifications to the Editorial Department, which handles typesetting. All Word docs provided by curatorial must be organized to conform to the needs of the Design Department—i.e., all case labels in one file, all text panels in a second, all wall labels in a third, and so on—and not exceed the maximum word count for each type of label. For this reason, curators should meet with the graphic designer assigned to the project before beginning to write. Label copy thus organized should be emailed to the Editorial Department. The editor will provide each curator with edited text with all corrections, suggestions, and queries in Word documents with tracked changes. Editorial will email the curator a PDF of the first proofs; the curator should note corrections in red on a printout or in the PDF file(s) using Adobe sticky notes. Editor and curator will decide which method to use, but PDF is usually preferred, as it is faster. First proofs should be returned to the editor in a timely fashion. If necessary, second proofs will be generated; curators generally do not review second proofs.\n The importance of timely delivery of material to Editorial cannot be overemphasized. Because special exhibitions follow tight schedules, all copy for text panels and labels should be submitted to the Editorial Department at least twelve weeks before the opening. After initial edits, the Director’s Office will review introductory panels and text panels for certain special exhibitions and further edits will be made if necessary. If material must be delivered in sections, priority should be given to copy that is to be silk-screened (usually, intro panels and wall panels).\n Permanent Installation and Replacement Labels Labels for permanent installation rotations that have been approved and scheduled with the Exhibitions Department, as well as labels to update or correct existing text, are due to Editorial ten weeks prior to the installation. Rotation and replacement labels will be edited and produced as quickly as possible; please note, however, that time-sensitive projects, such as major exhibition labels, might have to take precedence.\n Length of Labels Exhibition texts should be brief and concise. In general, text panels cannot exceed 250 words (or 200 if they include an image with a caption); wall labels, 125 words; and case labels, 75 words. These word counts do not include tombstones. Please note that these numbers are estimates only: final word counts may need to be adjusted in editing to ensure that the typeset text fits on the label, depending on the particular label design, length of object information, etc. Again, please meet with the graphic designer assigned to your exhibition before you begin writing, as there may be exceptions to these general guidelines depending on specific gallery configurations.\n Label Templates The following label styles have been devised with the needs of the various curatorial departments in mind; only one style should be adopted per gallery or exhibition. If the specific exhibition requires altering one of these templates, including reordering the information, please confer with the editor:\n1 Maker (nationality, birth/death dates if known) [in certain departments—DPP,  Photographs—nationality and birth/death dates are on next line]  Title, date  Medium  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 1  Goya (Francisco de Goya y Lucientes) (Spanish, Fuendetodos 1746–1828  Bordeaux)  Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuñiga, 1787–88  Oil on canvas  The Jules Bache Collection, 1949 (49.7.41)\n2  Title  Medium [if appropriate]  Maker (nationality, birth/death dates if known)  Date [+ place]  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 2  Adam  Marble  Tullio Lombardo (ca. 1455–1532) Italian (Venice), ca. 1490–95  Fletcher Fund, 1936 (36.163)\n3  Title  Medium  Cultural designation, object date  Find spot (if known/appropriate)  Credit line followed by accession number in parentheses on same line\nEXAMPLE FOR STYLE 3  Virgin and Child Reliquary  Walnut with paint, tin relief on a white lead ground, linen  French, Auvergne, carved about 1175–1200  Gift of J.

Havemeyer, 1929  (29.100.223)\nNoted for its imaginative designs and innovative techniques, Jizhou ware was produced at kilns in Jiangxi Province in southern China. Here, paper-cut plum blossoms were placed on an initial layer of black glaze and covered with brown glaze. The paper cuts were destroyed during the firing, leaving the design of plum blossoms on the inside of the bowl. \n(Note: In the tombstone, “The Metropolitan Museum of Art” is not used in the credit line for rotation labels of permanent collection objects.)\n General Label Style See Dates\nDo not use periods at the ends of lines in the tombstone.\nUse serial commas (e.g., “Ink, oil, and acrylic” rather than “Ink, oil and acrylic”).\nIn a chat, spell out numbers from one hundred down (“eleven prints in the series”) as well as centuries (“fifteenth,” not “15th”) but use numerals in the tombstone. An exception in tombstones is a fraction of a century: “First third 14th century.”\nEnclose question marks in parentheses and do not leave a space following the preceding word: “Italian(?), ca. 1400.”\n“Ex coll.” may be included at the discretion of the department. If it is a matter of particular sensitivity, it should be flagged in TMS.\nDates of an artist’s activity do not appear in the tombstone unless artist’s birth/ death dates are unknown. When needed, use “active” rather than “recorded” or “flourished.”\nFor anonymous works, use country or culture followed by a comma and the date (French, 15th century) and do not include the word “anonymous.”\nHowever, do leave “anonymous” in TMS as a sorting mechanism; use “anonymous” instead of “artist unknown” or other variant wordings.\n","id":22,"length":1129,"title":"Foreign Language Guidelines","type":"page","url":"https://ameeramoumina.github.io/style-guide-demo/appendices/3/"}]
