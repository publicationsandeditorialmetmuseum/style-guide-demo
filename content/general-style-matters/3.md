Use word-by-word method:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raj Singh <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rajasthan, India <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rajput dynasty <br/>

Treat “Mc” names as though spelled “Mac.”

To alphabetize names with particles, follow personal preference of individual or tradition if the person is famous. Consult the latest edition of *Merriam-Webster’s Biographical Dictionary.*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; de Groot, Adelaide Milton <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; du Pont, Henry Francis <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; van Eyck, Jan <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; von Bothmer, Dietrich <br/>

Names with “St.” should be alphabetized as if “Saint” were spelled out.
