In general, it is best to avoid excessive use of capitals, and do not use them to emphasize an idea.

#### *Use capitals for:*

“Museum,” when referring to the Metropolitan; the word “The” in referring to The Metropolitan Museum of Art (but only when using the full name of the institution)

Proper names of organizations, *but* not for incomplete references (Congress of Vienna, *but* the congress). Do not capitalize “The” before museum or organization names in running text (except for The Metropolitan Museum of Art)

Styles and schools of art when referring to a specific movement (Abstract Expressionism, Art Deco, Precolumbian art), *but* lowercase “school” unless it is part of the name of a specific movement (school of Leonardo, but School of Paris, New York School); “Neoclassicism” when referring specifically to the late eighteenth century and the Napoleonic era; “Baroque” when referring to European seventeenth-century art, but not when used in a general sense

Historical periods (Dynasty 18 or XVIII Dynasty, *but* Tang dynasty; Roman Empire, *but* the empire)

Parts of the world (Southeast Asia, Middle East, Western world, but eastern direction, western saddle)

Do not capitalize prepositions, conjunctions, or articles in book, article, and exhibition titles. However, do capitalize the first and last word of any title in English (*As Time Goes By*).
