Some exhibition and most collection catalogues contain entries for each object, preceded by an essay or essays giving more synthetic background information about the works; the period and place of their creation; the artist, school, or style; or the formation of the collection. Catalogue entries usually begin with a heading (“tombstone”) that gives basic information about each object or group of objects, as follows:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catalogue number (if used) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Artist, nationality, dates (omitted if book is a monograph) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Title of work* <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where created, date (date may also follow title) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Material/medium <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dimensions (may be on the same line as the material) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Signature/inscription information <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit line, followed by accession number in parentheses

Entries usually include text, which may vary in length depending on the nature of the catalogue. Comparative illustrations—illustrations (with captions) of alternate views, details, or related objects—may accompany the entry; these are usually given a set of numbers different from those of the catalogue objects and are referred to as “figures” or “comparatives” (“fig.” in captions or within parentheses).

Entries might also include separate elements, called “apparatus” (often set in smaller type than the heading and text), such as notes to the text of the entry, Provenance, References, Exhibitions, Condition, and Related Works. As an alternative, it has become increasingly common to place the apparatus at the back of the book in a comprehensive checklist, rather than include it with the entry.

Length of entries, inclusion and number of figures, and placement and extent of apparatus should be decided between the author and Editorial in the planning stages for the project.
