A selected bibliography should represent the scholarship that, in the authorâ€™s view, is essential for further research. It should include the most important sources cited in the notes as well as sources that delve more deeply into related topics (for example, a monograph about one of the artists represented in a group exhibition). Arrange the bibliography in alphabetical order by author/editor.

**BOOKS**: Last name, First name. Title: Subtitle. XX vols. [only for multivolume works] Series title XX. [if there is one] City: Publisher [full], date.
