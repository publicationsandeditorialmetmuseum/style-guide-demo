Our preference for **books with essays or chapters but no entries** is to follow The Chicago Manual of Style, which calls for the full reference in the initial citation and then a short form (author last name, short title, page number) in subsequent citations. This style obviates the need for a comprehensive bibliography and allows for more selective and focused bibliographical references. The resulting selected bibliography should be discussed at an early point by the curator/author and Editorial. Below are some examples. For trickier citations or general questions, please consult with your editor. The online version of The Chicago Manual of Style (16th ed.) is available to MMA staff and onsite visitors to the MMA through [Watsonline](http://libmma.org/portal/the-chicago-manual-of-style-online/).
