Most MMA publications contain endnotes and a bibliography. Collection and some exhibition catalogues might also contain special reference/exhibition histories. The author and Editorial Department should choose the bibliographic style together at the beginning of the project.

Any direct quotation from a primary or secondary source should be documented in a note, citing full bibliographic information and page numbers. Ideas or interpretations attributed to or facts discovered by another writer must also be documented. To avoid overwhelming the text with superscripts, references to ideas or interpretations can sometimes be grouped into a single note (for instance, at the end of the relevant paragraph).

Authors are responsible for paying close attention to accuracy and completeness in noting authors’ names, titles, dates and places of publication, volume numbers, page and figure numbers, etc., and to consistency between notes and bibliography. Authors are required to check quoted passages for accuracy. Please follow the basic forms given below for the citations. If there is more information than the examples below call for, by all means include it in the citation and the editor will make any necessary style changes. **Please note that the bibliographic editor’s job is to edit the notes and references for style and consistency, not to research missing information, which is the responsibility of the author.**

The bibliography should be assembled in a single alphabetized file according to authors’ last names. Multiple works by the same author should be arranged
chronologically from earliest to most recent. In the notes or bibliography, give all citations in full so that the editor is clear what reference is intended.

The following guidelines assume two different approaches for citing sources—the Chicago style (“long form”) and MLA style (“short form”).
