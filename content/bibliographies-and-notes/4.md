**For books with entries and/or elaborate apparatus,** our preference is to use a modified version of the Modern Language Association (MLA) author-date system. In notes and apparatus, short-form citations are given with the last name(s) of author(s) followed by the year of publication and page number(s). <br/>
Full citations appear in a comprehensive bibliography at the end of a book


The following are examples of notes that cite books, journal articles, essays within books, exhibition and sale catalogues, archives, and websites (see full citations in “Preparation of Bibliographies for Books with Entries” above).
