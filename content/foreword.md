The purpose of this guide is twofold: to explain and describe the procedures followed by the Editorial Department of The Metropolitan Museum of Art for all Museum publications and all labels for exhibitions and permanent installations; and to present the basic stylistic conventions that have been adopted for most written Museum content. The guide has been designed for use by curators and other authors who work in or outside the Museum, by their assistants, and by editors, production managers, and proofreaders, and by other Museum departments that create published content, whether in print or online.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This guide is not intended to establish an inflexible house style, as every manuscript has its own particular characteristics and requirements; it does, however, address areas of confusion about which the Editorial Department frequently receives inquiries with a view toward establishing an ideal set of guidelines and practices for use in most situations.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The guide is divided into three parts. The first outlines the procedures involved in producing books and catalogues, as well as labels; the second provides a style guide for use in writing and editing Museum publications; and the third specifically addresses bibliographies and notes, as these are among the most complicated components of most of our publications.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the Editorial Department regards certain reference books as authoritative (these volumes are listed in the section titled Sources), many of the Museum’s special needs and functions are not addressed in these publications. In addition, specialized usages have been adopted by Museum editors over the years. Therefore, in the interest of Museum-wide consistency, recommended usages for many different types of material are given herein. The aim is not only to help authors but also to aid readers and visitors who might otherwise be confused or distracted by variations in spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and so on.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The primary role of the Editorial Department is to make sure that texts are clear, accurate, and consistent, and that books are produced at the highest level of quality that schedule and budget will allow. Authors are expected to deliver accurate and complete manuscripts on time, and the editor assigned to the project is responsible for correcting errors of grammar and spelling, suggesting rewording or reorganization to achieve greater clarity, and querying any questionable facts or inconsistencies. It is also the editor’s responsibility to work with the designer and the Editorial production staff to ensure that the text and illustrations are integrated into an accurate, appropriate, and attractive publication and that schedules and budgets are respected.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is worth noting here that *The Chicago Manual of Style*, the standard reference accepted by virtually all American publishers, is now in its sixteenth edition (and is available in an online edition as well), and it bears very little resemblance to the first edition. Like *Chicago*, this style guide will continue to undergo changes over its lifetime, and suggestions will happily be considered.
